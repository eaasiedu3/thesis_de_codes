In Ghana, the fight against HIV takes center stage, particularly when it comes to protecting newborns from mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). This study delves into the hidden dynamics of how HIV moves from mothers to their infants, revealing critical insights that could shape the future of healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa. Using a robust simulation model, we explore key stages of transmission, focusing on the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART), maternal health, and socio-demographic factors.
Our research brings to life compelling trends—such as the drastic reduction in HIV transmission with proper ART adherence—and highlights the role that factors like access to healthcare and rural-urban disparities play in these outcomes. While current preventive strategies, such as ART and early infant diagnosis (EID), have shown great promise, our findings uncover gaps that must be addressed to save even more lives.
This study not only underscores the urgent need for stronger healthcare systems in underserved areas but also calls for integrating prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services into broader public health initiatives. Long-term projections reveal that with targeted interventions and improved infrastructure, the dream of eliminating MTCT in Ghana could soon become a reality. Our research paves the way for innovative public health strategies, offering a roadmap toward a future where no child is born with HIV.
